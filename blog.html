                    What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create,
                        change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make
                        our page more dynamic.</p>
                    <p>By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update
                        the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are
                        customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh. You can drag,
                        move, and delete elements.</p>

                    How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Elements in an HTML document are available directly as document properties. For example, the
                        <'html'> element can be accessed with document.documentElement property, whereas the
                            <'head'> element can be accessed with document.head property, and the
                                <'body'> element can be accessed with document.body property.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Elements by ID: <br>
                        You can select an element based on its unique ID with the getElementById() method. This is the
                        easiest way to find an HTML element in the DOM tree.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Elements by Class Name: <br>
                        Similarly, you can use the getElementsByClassName() method to select all the elements having
                        specific class names. This method returns an array-like object of all child elements which have
                        all of the given class names. Let's check out the following example:
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div tabindex="0" class="collapse collapse-arrow border border-base-300 bg-base-100 rounded-box">
                <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                    What is event bubble?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element
                        receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to
                        its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div tabindex="0" class="mt-6 collapse collapse-arrow border border-base-300 bg-base-100 rounded-box">
                <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                    What is a callback function and why will you use it?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>In JavaScript, functions are objects. We pass objects to functions as parameters.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down order. However, there are some cases that code runs
                        (or must run) after something else happens and also not sequentially. This is called
                        asynchronous programming.</p>
